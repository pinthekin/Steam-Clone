## Project Summary

Many people buy and play video games from Steam, one of the most popular video game distribution platforms. However, when accessing the storefront web page, the interface is cluttered with redundant pages to filter by genre, ads for Valve products, and more. We want to devise a cleaner, minimalistic, and more intuitive version of the Steam website store dedicated for browsing games.
